            <h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
            <p class="main-info">
                Roasting coffee transform the chemical and physical properties of raw coffee beans into roasted
                coffee products. This process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green
                beans to change in taste. Many coffee roasters determine the level of roast by eye, assessing
                the color of the beans to determine the desired roast-level.
